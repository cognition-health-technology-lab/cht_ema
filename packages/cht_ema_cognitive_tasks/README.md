**CHT-EMA Cognitive Tasks** is a Flutter package developed by the [CHT Lab](https://github.com/cognition-health-technology-lab) for building ecological momentary assessment (EMA) cognitive tasks in cognition and health research.

## It provides customizable pre-built cognitive tasks and tools for building them from scratch. The cognitive tasks provided support internationalization (English/Spanish by default).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Documentation is coming soon!

For now, the **best way to see how it works** is to check the included [example app](example/lib/main.dart).

It demonstrates:

- How to initialize the package
- How to load translations
- How to run the cognitive tasks

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
